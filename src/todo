training: less questions

Info:
CrowdMOs compares algorithms... each hit will have questions from seperate algorithm
each HIt should contains all exmaples generated by same algorithm? e.g generated confidence top,generated confidence bottom, ensemble top, ensemble bottom..
same text for all?even ensemble?

Do not have same text twice in same hit:under the constraint that the same HIT never contains two samples created from the same test signal (for example, the same utterance). Thus,



in a batch file:
each row is a hit
I cna have like 1-3 rows


Done:1)format <h4><b>q?</b></h4>text
2) replace ' with `
3) replace , with ;;

test ids: is it really the question

show examples selected already

fix names/ids in amazon inputs to be the question string itself
