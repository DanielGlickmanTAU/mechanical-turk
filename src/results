Algorithm one- no one is sure.
Algorithm     Diff: mu = 3.20, CI = 0.31
Algorithm      Rel: mu = 4.04, CI = 0.21

Algorithm two - all is sure.
Algorithm     Diff: mu = 2.99, CI = 0.37
Algorithm      Rel: mu = 4.29, CI = 0.22


Algorithm 3 - least confident generated
Diff: mu = 3.14, CI = 0.33
Rel: mu = 4.03, CI = 0.24

Algorithm 4 - most confident
Diff: mu = 3.29, CI = 0.28
Rel: mu = 3.46, CI = 0.36
