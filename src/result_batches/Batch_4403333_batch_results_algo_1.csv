Many cultures and legal systems impose duties and responsibilities on persons connected by this relationship. A person is a son-in-law or daughter-in-law to the parents of the spouse, who are in turn also the parents of those sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law (if any) who are siblings of the spouse (as opposed to spouses of siblings). Together the members of this family affinity group are called the in-laws.","false","U_A:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/89.0.4389.114 Safari/537.36;CookieEnabled:true;AppV:5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/89.0.4389.114 Safari/537.36;Platform:Win32;LN:en-US;cookie_debug:Train Exist*Setup Exist*Counter:0*;","5","3","4","3","","4","","5","","4","","5","","","","4","4","","","2","","","{}","-1","4","4","4","4","","5","","4","","3","","4","","","","5","3","","","4","","","","3","3","4","4","4","5","0","-1","-1","-1"
